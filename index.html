    <h1>Insertion Sort</h1>
    <p>
      Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted
      array one element at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than
      more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
      However, it performs well for small datasets or nearly sorted datasets and
      is often used in practice for those scenarios.

    <p>Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Insertion Sort algorithm</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <b
          >Start with the second element (index 1) and assume it is the only
          element in the sorted part of the array</b
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <b
          >Compare the second element with the first element. If the second
          element is smaller, swap them.</b
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>
          Move to the third element (index 2) and insert it into its proper
          position in the sorted part by comparing it with elements in the
          sorted part and shifting them if necessary.</b
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <b
          >Repeat this process for each element in the array until the entire
          array is sorted.</b
        >
      </li>
    </ol>
